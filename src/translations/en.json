      "title": "The Ragdoll Breed: A Brief History",
      "paragraph1": "The Ragdoll cat breed was developed in California, USA, during the 1960s by breeder Ann Baker. The breed is named for its characteristic tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up, resembling a child's ragdoll toy. Ragdolls are known for their striking blue eyes, semi-long silky coat, and color-point patterns.",
      "paragraph2": "Ragdolls are among the largest domestic cat breeds, with males weighing 15-20 pounds and females 10-15 pounds. They are renowned for their gentle, affectionate, and docile temperament, making them ideal family companions. The breed was officially recognized by major cat registries in the 1960s-1970s and has since become one of the most popular cat breeds worldwide.",
      "quote": "Ragdolls are the gentle giants of the cat world - affectionate, intelligent, and wonderfully calm."

We can also arrange for you to pick up your kitten personally from our cattery in Bulgaria. Contact us to discuss shipping options and costs to your specific location."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Ragdoll cats good family pets?",
        "answer": "Ragdoll cats are exceptional family companions known for their gentle, affectionate, and docile temperament. They are called 'Ragdolls' because they tend to go limp and relaxed when picked up. These beautiful blue-eyed cats are highly social, forming strong bonds with their families and getting along wonderfully with children and other pets. Ragdolls are intelligent, trainable, and generally quiet cats with soft, melodious voices. Unlike many cat breeds, Ragdolls typically enjoy being held and cuddled, making them perfect lap cats. Their calm nature and adaptable personality make them ideal for families, seniors, and first-time cat owners."
      },
      {
        "question": "What color patterns do your Ragdoll kittens come in?",
        "answer": "BleuRoi Cattery breeds Ragdoll kittens in all three recognized patterns: Colorpoint (solid color points on ears, face, legs, and tail), Mitted (colorpoint with white mittens on paws and white chin), and Bicolor (white inverted 'V' on face with white chest, legs, and belly). Our kittens come in various beautiful colors including seal, blue, chocolate, lilac, red, and cream. All Ragdolls have striking blue eyes. Browse our available kittens page to see current colors and patterns, or contact us about upcoming litters if you're looking for a specific color combination."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I reserve a Ragdoll kitten from your cattery?",
        "answer": "Reserving a Ragdoll kitten from BleuRoi Cattery is simple! First, browse our 'Available Kittens' page or contact us about upcoming litters. Once you've selected a kitten, we'll discuss your family situation, experience with cats, and home environment to ensure a perfect match. A reservation deposit secures your chosen kitten. We maintain regular contact with updates, photos, and videos as your kitten grows. Kittens join their new families at 12-14 weeks of age, fully vaccinated, microchipped, and socialized. We provide comprehensive guidance on Ragdoll care, nutrition, and training. Contact us via phone (+359894 474 966), email (info@ragdollbleuroi.eu), or social media to begin the reservation process."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is included when I buy a Ragdoll kitten from BleuRoi?",
        "answer": "Every Ragdoll kitten from BleuRoi Cattery comes with a complete package ensuring the best start in their new home: Authentic pedigree papers from FIFe/WCF registries showing champion bloodlines, European pet passport with full travel documentation, two core vaccinations (FVRCP), microchip implantation and registration, comprehensive veterinary health examination and certificate, deworming treatments, kitten starter kit including food samples, care instructions, and toy, lifetime breeder support and guidance, and a written health guarantee. We also provide detailed information about feeding, grooming, health care, and training your Ragdoll kitten."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the temperament of Ragdoll cats?",
        "answer": "Ragdoll cats are known as 'gentle giants' with exceptional temperament. They are extremely affectionate and loving, with a docile and calm demeanor. Ragdolls are patient with children, sociable with other pets, and intelligent enough to be easily trained. They have a low-maintenance personality and a characteristic tendency to go limp when held (hence 'Ragdoll'). These loyal cats often follow their owners around and are quieter than most cat breeds, making them ideal companions for any home environment."
      },
      {
        "question": "At what age can Ragdoll kittens leave for their new homes?",
        "answer": "Ragdoll kittens from BleuRoi Cattery leave at 12-14 weeks of age minimum. This ensures kittens are fully weaned and eating independently, properly socialized with littermates, litter box trained, have received both core vaccinations, developed strong immune systems, and are ready for the transition to their new home. This extended time with their mother and siblings is crucial for developing proper social skills and confident, well-adjusted personalities."
